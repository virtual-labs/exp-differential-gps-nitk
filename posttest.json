      "question": "DGPS uses a network of___________________ to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the GPS satellite system and known fixed positions",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Fixed ground-based reference stations",
        "b": "Fixed satellite station",
        "c": "Fixed reference stations",
        "d": "Fixed area based reference stations"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Fixed ground-based reference stations: This is the correct answer. DGPS uses a network of fixed ground-based reference stations to broadcast the difference between the positions indicated by the GPS satellite system and known fixed positions.",
        "b": "Fixed satellite station: This is not the correct answer. DGPS uses ground-based reference stations, not satellite stations.",
        "c": "Fixed reference stations: This is not the correct answer. DGPS uses ground-based reference stations, not reference stations that can be fixed or movable.",
        "d": "Fixed area based reference stations: This is not the correct answer. DGPS uses ground-based reference stations that are fixed and located at specific positions."

    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of DGPS in surveying?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To provide accurate and precise positioning data",
        "b": "To identify and correct for errors in GPS signals",
        "c": "To eliminate the need for ground-based reference stations",
        "d": "To provide real-time weather information"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "DGPS can provide accurate and precise positioning data, but its primary purpose is to correct errors in GPS signals.",
        "b": "The primary purpose of DGPS in surveying is to identify and correct the errors in GPS signals.",
        "c": "DGPS requires ground-based reference stations to broadcast correction information, so it does not eliminate the need for them.",
        "d": "DGPS does not provide real-time weather information."

      "question": "In the RTK method, the base is placed over an unknown point.(say true or false)",
      "answers": {
        "a": "True",
        "b": "False"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The base station in the RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) method is placed over a known point with accurate coordinates. This known point is typically a surveyed point with a known coordinate value.",
        "b": "The base station in RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) method is placed over a known point with accurate coordinates. This known point is typically a surveyed point with a known coordinate value."

      "question": "Which one of the following places do not have a fixed ground-based reference station in India?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Kolkata",
        "b": "Lucknow",
        "c": "Bangalore",
        "d": "Hyderabad"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Kolkata, Bangalore, and Hyderabad have fixed ground-based reference stations in India for DGPS surveys.",
        "b": "Lucknow does not have fixed ground based reference stations in India for DGPS surveys.",
        "c": "Kolkata, Bangalore, and Hyderabad have fixed ground-based reference stations in India for DGPS surveys.",
        "d": "Kolkata, Bangalore, and Hyderabad have fixed ground-based reference stations in India for DGPS surveys."

    {
      "question": "Which one of the following statements is false in the case of DGPS survey requirements?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "A clear view of the sky is necessary",
        "b": "There is no need to be provided with the known coordinates of a point in an area to start the survey initially",
        "c": "Line of sight with the base is necessary",
        "d": "Both b and c"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "A clear view of the sky is necessary: True, because GPS signals come from satellites in space and require an unobstructed view of the sky.",
        "b": "The rover station can be a mobile system to take to different locations of unknown coordinates: True, because the purpose of the rover is to move around to different locations and collect GPS data.",
        "c": "The base station is not a stationary system: False, because the base station is a stationary system that provides corrections to the GPS signals received by the rover.",
        "d": "Both b and c: False, because option b is true and option c is false."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
